The first and foremost most important thing in this problem is recognizing the difference between an Euler Path and an Euler circuit. Euler paths are undirected graphs with a path through every edge.
Euler Circuits are the same thing except the starting and ending vertex are the same.  

Reduction from EULPATHCOMP to EULCIRCUITCOMP:



Reduction from EULCIRCUITCOMP to EULPATHCOMP:
Based on the above definition of Euler Paths and Circuits, all Euler Circuits are a subset of Euler paths, since
all of them go through all the edges. The starting and end points are the same each time. Based on the definition of 
EULPATHCOMP, G is a complete undreicted graph through every edge withs starting point s and ending point t. Based on the
euler circuit definition, if s and t are both set as equal, then the Euler circuit will have been successfully reduced to 
an euler path.
