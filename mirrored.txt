Using A_tm, an undecidable language we can polytime reduce this to R. Once we have shown that this undecidable language can be reduced, in polynomial time, to the language described by R, then we know that language R is also undecidable. And so by using mapping reducability, we will have arrived at the conlusion that R is undecidable. 

Proving the reduction:
For a machine F,
F = "On input <M, w>:
    1. Construct machine M'.
    M' = "on input x
        1. Run M on the reverse of x
        2. If M accepts, accept
        3. If M rejects, enter a loop."
    2. Output <M', w>"
